      identifier:
        type: "string"
        description: |
          special attribute of remote source file. This field is used with taskURL to generate new taskID to
          indetify different downloading task of remote source file. For example, if user A and user B uses
          the same taskURL and taskID to download file, A and B will share the same peer network to distribute files.
          If user A additionally adds an indentifier with taskURL, while user B still carries only taskURL, then A's
          generated taskID is different from B, and the result is that two users use different peer networks.
      path:

        description: |
          path is used in one peer A for uploading functionality. When peer B hopes

          Then when creating a task in supernode, peer A must provide this URL in request.

        description: |
          extra HTTP headers sent to the rawURL.
          This field is carried with the request to supernode. 
          Supernode will extract these HTTP headers, and set them in HTTP downloading requests
          from source server as user's wish.

          This field is for debugging. When caller of dfget is using it to files, he can pass callSystem
          name to dfget. When this field is passing to supernode, supernode has ability to filter them via 
          some black/white list to guarantee security, or some other purposes.

          For image distribution, this is image layer's URL in image registry.
          The resource url is provided by command line parameter.
      taskURL:
        type: "string"
        description: |
          taskURL is generated from rawURL. rawURL may contains some queries or parameter, dfget will filter some queries via
          --filter parameter of dfget. The usage of it is that different rawURL may generate the same taskID.
      md5:
        type: "string"
        description: |
          md5 checksum for the resource to distribute. dfget catches this parameter from dfget's CLI
          and passes it to supernode. When supernode finishes downloading file/image from the source location,
          it will validate the source file with this md5 value to check whether this is a valid file.
      identifier:
        type: "string"
        description: |
          special attribute of remote source file. This field is used with taskURL to generate new taskID to
          indetify different downloading task of remote source file. For example, if user A and user B uses
          the same taskURL and taskID to download file, A and B will share the same peer network to distribute files.
          If user A additionally adds an indentifier with taskURL, while user B still carries only taskURL, then A's
          generated taskID is different from B, and the result is that two users use different peer networks.
      path:
        type: "string"
        description: |
          path is used in one peer A for uploading functionality. When peer B hopes
          to get piece C from peer A, B must provide a URL for piece C.
          Then when creating a task in supernode, peer A must provide this URL in request.
      headers:
        type: "object"
        description: |
          extra HTTP headers sent to the rawURL.
          This field is carried with the request to supernode. 
          Supernode will extract these HTTP headers, and set them in HTTP downloading requests
          from source server as user's wish.
        additionalProperties:
          type: "string"
      dfdaemon:
        type: "boolean"
        description: |
          tells whether it is a call from dfdaemon. dfdaemon is a long running
          process which works for container engines. It translates the image
          pulling request into raw requests into those dfget recganises.
      callSystem:
        type: "string"
        description: |
          This field is for debugging. When caller of dfget is using it to files, he can pass callSystem
          name to dfget. When this field is passing to supernode, supernode has ability to filter them via 
          some black/white list to guarantee security, or some other purposes.
